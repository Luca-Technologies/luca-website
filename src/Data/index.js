        The word Luca is the first name of an Italian mathematician, Luca
        Pacioli who is referred to as &quot;The Father of Accounting and
        Bookkeeping&quot; was the first person to publish a work on the
        double-entry system of book-keeping.
        <br />
        <br />
        His work revolutionized how businesses oversaw their operations,
        enabling improved efficiency and profitability. Accounting
        practitioners, as well as investors, lending institutions, business
        firms, and all other users for financial information, are indebted to
        Luca for his monumental role in the development of accounting.
        <br />
        <br />
        At Luca, we are continuing in the phenomenal work, but this time
